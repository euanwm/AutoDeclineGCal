# DEATH TO POINTLESS MEETINGS
That's right. Kill 'em.

## Limitations
Currently, it only declines meetings made on the current day. Feel free to open a PR, or don't. Who the fuck am I to tell you what to do?

### Step 1
Copy the code from "TheDecliner.gs" into a new AppsScript project.

### Step 2
Set the USER_CAL variable to whatever email address is the default for your calendar. If you have multiple calendars it *might* work but it'll probably work on your default one.

### Step 3
Save the file and navigate to the "Triggers" sub-menu (left-side).

### Step 4
Create a new trigger, you should only need to change the event source to be from your calendar and only when it's updated. You'll need to insert your email address as well.

You could / should probably add a second trigger at the start of the day so you don't have to worry about the initial update trigger being tripped.

### Step 5
Get spoken to by HR because middle-management don't understand that it's an automation that highlights their incompetence.
